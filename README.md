# MathOrDeath

MathOrDeath will be an open-source math game made in C++ using the SDL engine.
It is currently still in development.

It is primarily being developed for Windows, but I guarantee a Linux version
with every *full* release!

I apologise, but every version before v0.1.5 was deleted due to a technical
error.

You can compile the source code using the instructions under
"docs/how_to_compile.md".
