# MathOrDeath

MathOrDeath will be an open-source math game made in C++ using the SDL engine.
It is currently still in development.

It is primarily being developed for Windows 11, but I guarantee a Linux version
with every *full* release!

You can compile the source code using the instructions under
"docs/how_to_compile.md".
