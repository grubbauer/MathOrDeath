# MathOrDeath

MathOrDeath will be an open-source math game made in C++ using the SDL engine. It is currently still in 
development.

Currently it is being developed for primarly windows, but I garantee you a  linux version every *full* 
release! The reason is because Windows way to compile requires at least *some* kind of modification in the
code. I will also try to provide a version compilable with Clang and another version compilable with the 
Gnu C Compiler.

I apologise but all versions before v.0.0.1-5 were completly lost due to a critical software error.

*Note*: Because of the limitaions of Windows, the gcc compiled version will only be avaliable on linux.
