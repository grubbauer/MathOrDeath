# MathOrDeath

MathOrDeath will be an open-source math game made in C++ using the SDL engine.
It is currently still in development.

It is primarily being developed for Windows, but I guarantee a Linux version
with every *full* release! The reason is that compiling on Windows requires at
least *some* modifications to the code. I will also try to provide a version
compilable with Clang and another version compilable with the GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC).

I apologize, but all versions before v.0.0.1-5 were completely lost due to
a critical software error.

*Note*: Because of the limitations of Windows, the GCC compiled version will
only be available on Linux.
