# MathOrDeath

MathOrDeath will be an open-source math game made in C++ using the SDL engine.
It is currently still in development.

Currently it is being developed for primarly windows, but I garantee you a 
linux version every *full* release! The reason is because Windows way to compile
requires at least *some* kind of modification in the code. I will also try to provide
a version compilable with Clang and another version compilable with the Gnu C Compiler.

*Note*: Because of the limitaions of Windows, the gcc compiled version will only be avaliable on linux.
